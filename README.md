# Make It DZI

This python script will provide a very simple Tkinter GUI that allows users to select the following file formats to convert to DZI:

- SVS
- TIFF
- TIF


# Installation and Usage

## For windows:

1. To install head over to the releases page and download the executable.
2. 2. Double click the executable to bring up the Tkinter GUI.


## For Unix:

1. Ensure you have Python3 and libvips installed. 
2. Clone this repository
3. Run using: `python make_it_dzi.py`


Note: Zipping the resultant folder and DZI was implemented but commented out due to issues when Windows zip format interfaced with Linux.
