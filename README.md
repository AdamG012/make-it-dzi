# Make It DZI

This python script will provide a very simple Tkinter GUI that allows users to select the following file formats to convert to DZI:

- SVS
- TIFF
- TIF

Note: Zipping the resultant folder and DZI was implemented but commented out due to issues when Windows zip format interfaced with Linux.
